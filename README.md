# Student Directory #

## Description ##
This is a project completed over the pre-course period of the Makers Academy web-development bootcamp.
The main goal of this project is to allow you to manage a list of students of a fictional school named "Villains Academy". The project defines methods to input, read, save and load student information.

## How to use ##
In order to use this project, you can simply clone/fork the ruby directory.rb file. All relevant production code is there. There are a few additional files but they are not relevant (although you can create your own .gitignore file to ignore any files you require).

The main method to call is named interactive_menu and this will provide you with all the options included in the program.
